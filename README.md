Campus Cart is a mobile app designed to help University of Vavuniya students manage essential needs in a centralized, user-friendly platform. The app offers three main features:

Buy & Sell: Students can list and buy gently-used items like furniture, electronics, and study materials, promoting sustainability and affordability.

Lost & Found: A dedicated space for reporting lost or found items, increasing chances of recovery for valuable belongings.

Boarding Accommodation: Lists affordable boarding options near campus, making it easier for students to find safe housing.
